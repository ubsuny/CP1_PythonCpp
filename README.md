### Homework 5

#### Problem 1
We include in this repository the images used in the report. The report details how we attempted the problems in the homework.

#### Problem 2
We also include in this repository, the c++ codes used in problem 2.
They are named: 

double_square.cc

float_square.cc

uint_square.cc

Each generates a square series, but each uses a different c++ data type to store the result. double_square.cc uses double. float_square.cc uses float. And uint_square.cc uses unsigned integer.

#### Problem 3
The modified c++ code to run in Jupyter notebook is named: double_square2.cpp. You can find it in the repository.
The setup file to run the compilation of the code is named setup2.py. It is also inside this repository.
