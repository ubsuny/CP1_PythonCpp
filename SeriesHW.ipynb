    "We are given the series $f_n = f_{n-1}^2$ to implement in C++. However, before implementing it we are asked to select three C++ data types and determine the maximum n that the selected data type can store. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will choose the int, long int, and float data types. In order to determine the maximum n that can be achieved, we look to the maximum value that these types can attain. These are as follows: 32,767, 65,535, and 2,147,483,647 for int, unsigned int, and long int, respectively. This means that we simple need to determine how many times we need to square the number 2 before it surpases each of these numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a regular scientific calculator, one can see that an int data type can store up to $n = 3$. The zeroth element is given as 2, squaring this gives the first element as 4, the second as 16, the third as 256, and the fourth would be 65,536, but this is outside of the scope of an int. For our second data type, the unsigned int, the overflow cap is 65,535. This would be able to store up to $n = 3$ by this same logic. For our third data type, the long int, the overflow cap is 2,147,483,647, meaning it could store up to $n = 4$."

Found below are three functions: the python implementation of the first part of the problem, the C++ implementation of the first part of the problem, and the C++ implementation for the second part of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these functions takes an integer for the maximum value that the data type we are interested in can take. These were listed earlier in the notebook. This means that we can use these functions for any data type as long as we know what the maximum value that the data type can take is.\n",
